NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION

TASK ANALYSIS:
The user wants the Home page to be displayed immediately when the website loads, rather than requiring users to click the Home navigation link.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- React Router is implemented with routes for all pages
- Home page route is set to "/" (root path)
- The routing configuration should already show Home page by default

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Check if the current routing setup in App.jsx properly defaults to Home page
2. Verify that the root route "/" is correctly configured
3. Test if there might be a routing issue preventing the default display

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
With React Router, when a user visits the root URL (http://localhost:5173/), the Home page should automatically render because it's mapped to the "/" route.

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- Missing default route configuration
- Incorrect route path setup
- Router not properly wrapping the app
- Development server not serving the correct entry point

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. VERIFY CURRENT ROUTING SETUP
   - Check App.jsx routing configuration
   - Ensure "/" route points to Home component
   - Confirm Router wraps the entire app

2. TEST CURRENT BEHAVIOR
   - Start development server
   - Visit root URL
   - Observe what displays initially

3. IF ISSUE EXISTS:
   - Add a default route or redirect
   - Ensure proper Router setup
   - Consider adding an "index" route

4. VERIFICATION:
   - Test that Home page loads on initial visit
   - Confirm navigation still works properly
   - Validate all other routes function correctly

PRIORITY: HIGH - This is a fundamental user experience issue that should be resolved immediately.

ESTIMATED TIME: 15-30 minutes for investigation and fix if needed.
